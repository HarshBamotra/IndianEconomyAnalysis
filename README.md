# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visulisation of Indian Economy
*This project is a part of Data analysis and visualisation paper taken in 5th semester.*

## Problem Statement (Subject to change in future) 
An economy is a collection of interconnected production and consumption processes that ultimately decide how resources are distributed within a community. The demands of persons who live there and conduct business there are met by the production and consumption of goods and services as a whole. Economic growth of a country depends upon different macroeconomics factors, which includes measurements of macroeconomic stability and performance, such as gross domestic product (GDP), consumption, investment, and international trade (central government budgets, prices, the money supply, and the balance of payments). To understand a nation's economy, it is crucial to do a thorough analysis of these variables. In order to give a better understanding of how the economy evolves in response to unforeseen events like politics, the environment, and other factors, we will analyse these elements utilising a variety of data analysis and visualisation approaches in this project. The analysis will help to better comprehend the economic distribution and the overall economic status of the nation, so that the office bearers can take better decisions towards the development of the country.

## Objectives
- To perform an in-depth analysis on the Indian economy.
- Compare the economy distribution of the country by state.
- Relate the change in economy with important political and environmental events.
